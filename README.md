# video_summary in my portfolio 
https://manoelmonteiro.github.io/portfolio/meusprojetos/Video_summary.html
 
This project consists of developing a Python tool capable of downloading YouTube videos, automatically transcribing the audio, explaining the content, and generating an intelligent summary, using advanced AI models from Groq, such as whisper-large-v3-turbo and groq/compound. The system was built in a Linux environment, using a venv virtual environment for isolation and organization of dependencies.

The main objective of the project is to simplify the consumption of information in videos, allowing the user to obtain a complete transcript, a detailed explanation, and a comprehensible summary, all in an automated way.
